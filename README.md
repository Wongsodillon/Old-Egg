# Old Egg
Create a NewEgg E-Commerce replica with a React TypeScript frontend, a Golang and Gin backend, and PostgreSQL as the database. 

## Lessons Learned

This is my first fullstack project, this project teaches me how to integrate a database and establish communication between the frontend and backend.
